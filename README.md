# My Personal Project

## Calorie Tracker

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

This application will first ask the user to
enter their weight *(lbs)*, height *(ft/in)* and
weight goal *(lbs)* to calculate
the recommended daily caloric intake for the user.
The user will need to enter everything they eat and
the serving size of what they ate for the program to
calculate the amount of calories they consumed. There
will be a database in the program with common foods
and meals so the program can use the calories already
entered for that food and just account for the serving
size the user enters. If the food isn't in the database,
the program will prompt the user to enter the calorie
count per serving, the serving size, and how much
of that food the user consumed. If the user eats the same thing
as their previous entry, they can simply duplicate the previous entry.
The program will sum the calories of every entry and inform the user
how many more calories they need or how many calories over
they are for the day. Each day
the total calorie count will be reset at 12:00 AM 
and the program will then inform the user how
close they were to their goal for that given day.
If the user doesn't open the program or doesn't
enter anything for a day, the program will ask if
they ate anything that day the next time they open the program.
The user can either enter
what they ate that day or the program will just input a 
calorie intake of 0 for that day. The user can also add in the amount of
calories they burned from any extensive exercise they did that day.
The program will also display the users results for the past 7 days. The user will also always
have the option to change their ideal weight, current weight and height.

Anybody wishing to hit certain weight goals or just watch their
eating habits can use this program. Although calories aren't
the only thing that constitutes healthy eating, it's a large
factor and definitely affects a person's weight fluctuations. I'm
interested in this project because I've recently been very drawn
to fitness so this seems like a sensible project to create which 
can align with my interests. I've been trying to get into better
shape by first building muscle then cutting fat. So by implementing
this project, I would first set it to gaining weight, then once I'm
happy with my weight, I'd set it to lose weight. Thus, this project
seems quite practical to me.

**User Stories**:
- As a user I want to be able to add the calories of something I ate to my caloric intake for that day
- As a user I want to be able to view my caloric intake for the past 7 days
- As a user I want to be able to set new weight goals and update my weight progress as I go
- As a user I want to be able to enter the previous thing I ate quickly by duplicating my previous entry.
